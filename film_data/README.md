This directory contains film SSF and characteristic curve data taken from various datasheets.

Some of the datasheets are not yet digitized with WebPlotDigitizer, but are linked here so I don't lose them.

Kodak Ultra Max 400 - https://apps.kodakmoments.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/E7023_max_400.pdf
Kodak Professional T-Max 400 - https://imaging.kodakalaris.com/sites/default/files/files/resources/f4043_TMax_400.pdf - this is black and white so dead last priority to do anything with right now for me
Kodak Gold 200 - https://imaging.kodakalaris.com/sites/default/files/files/resources/E7022_Gold_200.pdf - Appears to have very similar spectral sensitivity to Gold 400 from the late 1990s, as color rendering looks excellent when using a DCP generated from this data on late-1990s Gold 400 negatives
Fujia Superia X-Tra 400 - https://asset.fujifilm.com/master/emea/files/2020-10/9a958fdcc6bd1442a06f71e134b811f6/films_superia-xtra400_datasheet_01.pdf - DCP generated from these SSFs has excellent results when applied to late 1990s/early 2000s "Fuji S-400" negatives.  Colors look a bit funky when Gold200 SSF is applied

Currently looking for "Fuji Industrial 400" data as I have a digitized negative of that provided by a tester of my recent inversion experiments
